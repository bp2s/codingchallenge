# Coding Challenge !

## 1) Use Case
Alice, Bob and Carlos have each a todo-list.
Their list have been stored into the ethereum blockchain.

But, now they want to be able to see them in a web application....Can you help them ?

Your challenge, if you accept it, is to create a _quick & dirty_ application that displays the todos.

### Features
*  the list of the todos is dependant of the user
*  each user knows only his/her name (no particular IDs...)
*  todos are limited to only 3
*  if you can implement the addition of new todos, it would be great !

## 2) What to do ?

### Diagram
Here are the components to implement :

### Web Front
* in javascript / typescript
* UX/UI to design

### Backend
* in java
* stores the relation name <-> ID
* audit trail of all requests

### API
* Already available and started
* Not documented yet

## 3) What's expected ?

We would like you to show us :
* how you interact with other actors
* your technical approach (frameworks, tools, ...)
* the code !

Try to deliver a fully functionnal application, but if you're lacking time, don't panic ! 

The main objective is to see how you manage problems, and work as a team. There is no good or bad answer, the principle is the method.

To help, we are at your disposal :
* Khai Uy (Product Owner)
* Patricia (Functional Leader)
* Vincent (IT Advisor)
