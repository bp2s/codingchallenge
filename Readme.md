# Coding Challenge !

## 1) Use Case
Alice, Bob and Carlos have each a todo-list per day.
Their tasks are stored into the a centralized DB

But, now they want to be able to see them in a web application....Can you help them ?
Even more they want to be able to create and assign new tasks
Even more they want to ensure no one is overloaded of work

Your challenge, if you accept it, is to create a _quick & dirty_ application that will help them handle this

### Features
*  the list of the todos is dependant of the user
*  each user knows only his/her name (no particular IDs...)
*  todos are limited to only 3
*  adding new to dos
*  assign new to dos

## 2) What to do ?

### Diagram
Here are the components to implement :

### Web Front
* in javascript / typescript
* UX/UI to design

### Backend
* in java
* stores the relation name <-> ID
* audit trail of all requests

### API
* To put in place in order to expose what is store in the centralized DB

## 3) What's expected ?

We would like you to show us :
* how you interact with other actors
* your technical approach (frameworks, tools, ...)
* the code !

Try to deliver a fully functionnal application, but if you're lacking time, don't panic ! 

The main objective is to see how you manage problems, and work as a team. There is no good or bad answer, the principle is the method.

To help, we are at your disposal :
* Patricia (Product Owner)
* Patricia (UX Designer)
